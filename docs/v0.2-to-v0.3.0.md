# v0.2 to v0.3.0: What Changed

This document summarizes the practical delta for operators and contributors.

## Net Direction

`v0.3.0` narrows scope to make OpenClaw-on-Linux-VM deployments simpler and more reliable.

## What v0.3.0 Adds / Improves

1. VM-first startup path for OpenClaw (`acp start openclaw`)
2. nftables user-level egress enforcement in Linux VM mode
3. Single-command OpenClaw workspace bootstrap in VM mode
4. Improved consent-channel behavior and delivery handling
5. Host approval cache for repeated HTTP host approvals (short TTL)

## What You Lose vs v0.2

1. Less emphasis on generic, framework-agnostic "run anything anywhere" story
2. Docker-contained mode is no longer the primary architecture
3. Cross-platform expectations (macOS/Windows parity) are reduced for the main path
4. Features discussed in earlier docs but not implemented in current repo state (for example first-class credential vault semantics) are not part of the v0.3.0 primary path

## What Is Still Present But Secondary

1. `acp contain` Docker compatibility command
2. shell-wrapper concepts used by Docker containment mode

## Security Tradeoff to Be Aware Of

- VM mode currently prioritizes network mediation reliability.
- Default config location under user home means policy/config tampering by the runtime user is still possible unless operators harden file ownership/layout.

## Recommended Next Hardening Step

Move runtime policy/config/state to root-owned paths and run ACP under root-owned systemd units as the default installation profile.
